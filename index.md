# Guest Lecture

#### _AI in Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Spring '24_

Recently, I had the opportunity to deliver a guest lecture at Pune University, India on "AI in Medicine and Biomedical Sciences," and I shared my journey of working on tools like disease prediction systems for Parkinson’s and enhancing medical devices with AI. <br> For me, it’s all about using technology to empower doctors and improve patient care in meaningful ways.
